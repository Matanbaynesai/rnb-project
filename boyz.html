                <p>Boyz II Men remains one of the most truly iconic R&B groups in music history. The group redefined
                    popular R&B and continues to create timeless hits that appeal to fans across all generations. The
                    band has penned and performed some of the most celebrated classics of the past two decades. The
                    group’s 4 Grammy Awards are just the tip of the iceberg: throughout their 25-year career, Boyz II
                    Men have also won a whopping 9 American Music Awards, 9 Soul Train Awards, 3 Billboard Awards, and a
                    2011 MOBO Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music, a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, as well
                    and a Casino Entertainment Award for their acclaimed residency at the Mirage Resort and Casino in
                    Las Vegas, which has been ongoing since 2013.

                    The trio holds the distinction of being the best-selling R&B group of all time, with an astounding
                    64 million albums sold. And the reason is abundantly clear: for the past two decades Boyz II Men
                    have given fans a rich catalogue of hits filled with smooth harmonies and enduring themes. And for
                    Boyz II Men the hits just keep on coming—the group continues to craft new albums and bring their
                    legendary act to stages across the world.

                    Boyz II Men’s past hits include: “End of the Road,” “I’ll Make Love to You,” “One Sweet Day,”
                    “Motownphilly” and many others. And their recent albums have earned them major critical acclaim as
                    well. Their Decca label debut, Motown: A Journey Through Hitsville USA (Decca/Universal), on
                    November 13, 2007 earned them two Grammy Nominations.

                    In 2011, Boyz II Men marked their 20th anniversary by releasing a landmark album, fittingly titled
                    Twenty. The album contains the group’s first original material in nearly a decade as well as a dozen
                    remasetered classic, career-defining hits. Twenty debuted at #20 on the Billboard Top 200 Albums
                    Chart, #4 on the Billboard R&B album chart, #10 on the Billboard Digital Album Chart, and placed #1
                    on the iTunes R&B Soul Album chart. Twenty’s first single, "More Than You'll Ever Know" cracked into
                    the top 15 on Urban AC charts.

                    Boyz II Men have won fans the world over with their soulful multi-octave sound and incredible
                    vocals. Given the monumental success of their albums and the timeless quality of their vocals, it’s
                    easy to see why Boyz II Men remains the most popular R&B group of all time. Ask any successful pop
                    or R&B superstar which artists have inspired them- chances are Boyz II Men will be at the top. From
                    Justin Timberlake and Usher to Justin Bieber and Beyonce, the most successful stars in the industry
                    look to Boyz II Men as their idols.

                    Beyond making music, giving back is also important to Boyz II Men- the group has its own charity
                    called Boyz II Men House which lends support to individuals and organizations that focus on
                    improving quality of life and helping to unlock human potential, while contributing to the health
                    and vitality of those less fortunate.

                    Although Boyz II Men continues to tour across the country and around the globe, performing a mix of
                    their latest tracks and treasured classics, the group currently has a residency at famed Las Vegas
                    venue The Mirage through the end of 2018. Boyz II Men have made R&B accessible to the masses and
                    have helped the genre come into its own—and fans throughout the world flock to see them perform at
                    sold out shows. Fans were wowed in the summer of 2014 when Boyz II Men headed out on the
                    hotly-anticipated Package Tour with New Kids on the Block and 98 Degrees.

                    The group released a new album featuring original material through label BMG in October 2014 called
                    Collide. Collide is a landmark album for Boyz II Men, showcasing a new and different sound for one
                    of the most successful and enduring groups in mainstream music. Two of the tracks, “Better Half,”
                    and “Diamond Eyes” were featured on a special episode of ABC’s hit show, “The Bachelorette.” The
                    group also performed on FOX’s hit live show, Grease Live which aired on January 31, 2016 and their
                    performance became the most-tweeted moment. Most recently, Wanya Morris became a double threat
                    stepping on the dancefloor on ABC’s hit show “Dancing with the Stars,” where he and partner, Lindsay
                    Arnold, made it to the semifinals—ending on a high note with three tens.

                    Most recently, the group has released a Doo-Wop album called "Under The Streetlight".</p>
