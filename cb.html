                <p>Chris Brown Biography
                    (1989â€“)
                    UPDATED:MAY 5, 2020ORIGINAL:MAR 30, 2018
                    Chris Brown is a Grammy Award-winning R&B and dance music entertainer who made headlines for
                    assaulting former girlfriend Rihanna.
                    Who Is Chris Brown?
                    Chris Brown became a teen heartthrob with R&B and pop hits that included "Run It!," "Kiss Kiss" and
                    "Forever." In 2009, he physically assaulted his then-girlfriend, pop/dance star Rihanna, and found
                    his songs dropped from the radio. Afterward, Brown rediscovered success on the music charts, earning
                    a Grammy for his 2011 album, F.A.M.E., but also continued to receive attention for brushes with the
                    law.<br>

                    Young Star
                    Singer Christopher Maurice Brown was born on May 5, 1989, in Tappahannock, Virginia.<br> Brown became
                    known for his smooth voice, amazing dance moves, boy-next-door charm and controversy surrounding his
                    physical assault of former girlfriend Rihanna. Growing up in a small town of roughly 2,000 people,
                    Brown enjoyed singing in his church choir and was inspired by such musical artists as Sam Cooke,<br>
                    Stevie Wonder and Michael Jackson. He also showed off his dance prowess by imitating the moves of
                    another one of his idols, Usher.<br>

                    Brown was discovered by Tina Davis, who was working for Def Jam Recordings at the time. "The first
                    thing that hit me was his unique voice," Davis told Billboard magazine. "I thought 'This kid is a
                    star.'" Davis eventually became his manager and helped him land a deal with Jive Records, which had
                    developed other young acts such as Britney Spears and 'N Sync and was home to other hip-hop and R &
                    B stars such as R. Kelly, Usher and Kanye West. At the time of the deal, Brown was only 15 years
                    old.</p>
