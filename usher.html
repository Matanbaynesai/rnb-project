                <p>Usher, in full Usher Terry Raymond IV, (born October 14, 1978, Dallas, Texas, U.S.), American
                    musician whose smooth vocals and sensual ballads helped establish him as a rhythm-and-blues
                    superstar in the late 1990s.


                    As a youngster in Chattanooga, Tennessee, Usher sang in church choirs but sought entry into the
                    mainstream music industry by entering talent shows. At age 12 he moved with his mother and brother
                    to Atlanta, and two years later he secured a recording contract with LaFace Records. The album Usher
                    was released in 1994, with the 15-year-old singer moving beyond his choirboy background by
                    proclaiming that “it’s only a sexual thing” on the slow-groove single “Can U Get wit It.” The album
                    was not a commercial success, and Usher spent the next few years working on a follow-up, My Way
                    (1997), which marked him as a major R&B star. His singles “You Make Me Wanna” and “Nice & Slow”
                    became major R&B hits (the latter also topped Billboard’s all-genre singles chart), and the
                    performer reached greater audiences through appearances on television shows (he had a recurring role
                    on UPN’s Moesha series). In onstage performances, he showed prowess as a dancer that was as notable
                    as his fluid singing voice.

                    Usher’s third studio album, 8701 (2001), further cemented his reputation as a smooth, seductive, and
                    bankable artist. Music from 8701 gave Usher two number-one pop hits, “U Remind Me” and “U Got It
                    Bad,” and his first two Grammy Awards. On his fourth album, Confessions (2004), he extended his
                    range beyond ballads, collaborating most famously with Atlanta rappers Lil Jon and Ludacris on the
                    boisterous radio-dominating single “Yeah!” Confessions eventually sold more than 10 million copies
                    in the United States alone and earned Usher three Grammy Awards—for best contemporary R&B album,
                    best R&B performance by a duo or group (for “My Boo,” a duet with Alicia Keys), and best rap/sung
                    collaboration (for “Yeah!”).
